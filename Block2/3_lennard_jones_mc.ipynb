                "It takes twice as much heat to heat a kilogram of a material one degree Kelvin as it does to heat half a kilogram. That’s fairly intuitive. So when we talk about heat capacities, how much material are we talking about? The simplest way is to talk about the heat capacity per gram. This is known as the specific heat and is usually denoted by a small c. Done at constant volume it is $c_V$ . Specific heats are very practical since it is usually easy to weigh things. But the resulting values don’t tell us much about what is really going on. For instance, a gram of aluminium contains almost exactly 7.3 times as many atoms as a gram of gold. What would be interesting is the per atom (or more practically, the per mole) value of the heat capacity. And this molar heat capacity is usually what is given in tables. To avoid confusion the symbol for it is a capital $C$, $C_V$ . For the heat capacity at constant volume one can derive\n",

Derive a formula for the dimensionless heat capacity. Modify the function underneath and compute the heat capacity of the system. Do you get an expected value? Hint: If not, try to increase the density and think about why."
